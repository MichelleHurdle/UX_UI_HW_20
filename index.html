              <p>This collaborative project involved redesigning and rebranding a non-profit website and app in order to <b>increase visitor compliance</b> with the rules and guidelines for interactions with the wolves (the primary means of non-profit funding), as well as to increase wolf sponsorships. </p>

              <p>We had the valuable opportunity to engage in discussions with the stakeholder and owner of the rescue, regarding the non-profit and its specific <b>problems and needs</b>.  During these conversations, the stakeholder highlighted a recurring challenge she faces, wherein visitors often arrive without having familiarized themselves with the rules and guidelines outlined on the website prior to visiting. 

              <p>Consequently, she finds herself in the unenviable position of having to enforce these rules and occasionally turn away individuals, resulting in her feeling <b>burdened</b> with the role of the "bad guy."</p>

              <p class="mb-0">Recognizing the undesirability of this situation, we were determined to assist Kathy by presenting her with a website redesign aimed at reducing the frequency of such incidents. <b>Our objective</b> is to alleviate the need for her to assume this challenging role. Additionally, Kathy expressed a desire to enhance the visibility of wolf sponsorships on the website, an aspect we also aim to address in our proposed redesign.</p>

              <p>The research conducted for this project involved utilizing <b>surveys and user interviews</b>, including a significant interview session with the non-profit stakeholder.</p>
              <p>In our exploration of the both the stakeholder's and users' perspectives, we sought to understand their thoughts and feelings regarding wildlife sanctuaries or rescues. </p>
              <p>The following <b>key questions</b> guided our inquiry: </p>
              <ul>
                <li>What factors influence their decision-making and planning when visiting such sanctuaries?</li>
                <li>How do they perceive and engage with the concept of donating to these organizations?</li>
                <li>Are there additional ways in which they feel compelled to support these organizations, beyond monetary contributions?</li>
                <li>How do users navigate and utilize non-profit websites and the underlying motivations driving their behavior?</li>
              </ul>
              <p class="mb-0">Users generally affirmed the importance of some sort of <b>interaction</b> with wildlife, that non-profits need to make their mission clear, and it must be easy to access necessary visitor information.</p>
